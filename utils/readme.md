## Installation

There are no installation steps but it requires you have node.js and npm (node package manager) installed. You can check this by typing the following commands; node -v and npm -v. If both return version numbers, node.js and npm are installed. Ensure you have a compatible version. I'm creating this in 2024. As of now, version 18 or above will do fine.

## Usage
